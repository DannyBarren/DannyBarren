## Key Projects and Achievements

- LA Crime Prediction Model: Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Python to predict weekly violent crime clusters in Los Angeles using public crime data (2020–Aug 2025) and environmental factors. Achieved impressive accuracy; currently building a user-friendly app with heatmaps for predicted vs. actual crime visualizations. View on GitHub.
Autonomous Driving Neural Network: Built a CNN-based object detection model in Python for autonomous vehicles, delivering exceptional accuracy in identifying and classifying objects. View on GitHub.

- Loan Default Prediction: Created predictive models (including deep neural networks) in Python using TensorFlow and Keras to forecast loan defaults based on borrower data like credit history and economic indicators. Optimized for fintech risk assessment. View on GitHub | Version 2.
Employee Turnover Prediction: Designed an ML model in Jupyter Notebook to predict employee attrition, aiding HR in staffing strategies through data-driven insights. View on GitHub.
Music Analysis and Recommendation System: Implemented data science techniques in Jupyter Notebook to analyze music patterns, identify trends, and power AI-driven recommendation engines. View on GitHub.

- Workflow Automation at JPMorgan Chase: Automated multi-day data analytics processes using Python and Alteryx, reducing processing time from over 15 hours to under 1 hour. Developed scripts for invoice PDF data extraction and database management with Python/SQL.

- Market Forecasting and Campaign Analytics: Utilized forecasting models for $20M+ investment decisions and Excel-based geo-mapping for a U.S. Congressional campaign, contributing to a 14-point victory through data-driven voter outreach.

These projects and experiences demonstrate my ability to integrate Python, AI/ML, and data science for efficient, impactful solutions in high-stakes environments. Certified in Caltech AI/ML Programming (Python) and pursuing an MBA in Statistics and Analytics.

## Current Projects and Interests

I’m currently refining my Los Angeles violent crime prediction model, integrating it into a user-friendly application for law enforcement and public safety. The app allows users to input a week of the year (past data) to generate predictions, displaying results alongside two heatmaps: one for predicted crime clusters and one for actual data, enabling clear comparisons.

## Certifications and Education

I hold a certification from a Caltech-designed bootcamp in AI/ML programming in Python.

I’m pursuing an MBA with a specialization in statistics and analytics.

I also have a Bachelor’s in Russian Language, which enhances my work with large language models (LLMs). My linguistics background has been valuable in developing AI-powered translation tools for professionals in the translation industry.

## Additional Experience and Skills

My diverse background spans multiple industries, complementing my technical skills with strategic and analytical expertise:
- Directed political operations for a Congressional campaign, sharpening leadership and strategic planning abilities.
- Consulted for software companies, conducting market research to guide investments in emerging technologies.
- Managed Fintech vendor and consultant relationships in the financial services industry, overseeing contracts and partnerships.
