# Daniel Lee Barren

## About Me:

I’m a skilled programmer specializing in AI and machine learning, with deep expertise in Python for solving real-world problems through data science and analytics. My work focuses on creating impactful, innovative solutions using AI-driven approaches.

With extensive experience in Python, I’ve developed tools for data analytics, visualization, and automation. My portfolio includes advanced machine learning and AI models for diverse applications. Key projects include:

- A Python tool that automates data extraction from PDFs, producing DataFrames and CSVs for seamless analysis.
- An automation pipeline with a web scraper to collect data from online dashboards, integrated with analysis and visualization modules for professional presentations.
- High-accuracy AI models for predictive analytics and decision-making.

My GitHub repositories showcase my work, with two projects highlighting my capabilities:
- A convolutional neural network (CNN) for vehicle detection in autonomous driving systems, achieving exceptional accuracy.
- A CNN model predicting the location and frequency of violent crimes in Los Angeles using public crime and environmental data, delivering impressive results.

I’m open to collaborating on AI/ML projects. Reach out anytime to discuss ideas or opportunities where I can contribute value.

## Current Projects and Interests

I’m currently refining my Los Angeles violent crime prediction model, integrating it into a user-friendly application for law enforcement and public safety. The app allows users to input a week of the year (past data) to generate predictions, displaying results alongside two heatmaps: one for predicted crime clusters and one for actual data, enabling clear comparisons.

## Certifications and Education

I hold a certification from a Caltech-designed bootcamp in AI/ML programming in Python.

I’m pursuing an MBA with a specialization in statistics and analytics.

I also have a Bachelor’s in Russian Language, which enhances my work with large language models (LLMs). My linguistics background has been valuable in developing AI-powered translation tools for professionals in the translation industry.

## Additional Experience and Skills

My diverse background spans multiple industries, complementing my technical skills with strategic and analytical expertise:
- Directed political operations for a Congressional campaign, sharpening leadership and strategic planning abilities.
- Consulted for software companies, conducting market research to guide investments in emerging technologies.
- Managed Fintech vendor and consultant relationships in the financial services industry, overseeing contracts and partnerships.
